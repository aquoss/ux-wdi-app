Businesses in the food industry often find themselves throwing away good food when orders are mis-filled, or food remains unsold at the end of the day. This app connects restaurants/catering services with soup kitchens in an effort to reduce or eliminate this food waste. It allows restaurants to create a profile and schedule a pick-up or drop-off at a nearby soup kitchen, and allows soup kitchens to contact registered restaurants when they need more donations.

## Build
MEAN Stack
- AngularJS
- Express.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB


## Experience
positives: wireframes and layout flow, choosing what aspects were most important to include on the prototype from a user
perspective, initial design ideas
so easy to work with and talk through choices and compromises
balancing feasibility with user priorities (interesting to see what a developer vs ux designer brings to the table collaboration wise)
- excited to work with designers and get more design choice elements (fonts, colors, etc)
  - obviously couldn't do that this time around based on time restraints

it was their first time working with a developer and I can't recommend them enough

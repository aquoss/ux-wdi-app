# feedABLE
Businesses in the food industry often find themselves throwing away good food when orders are mis-filled, or food remains unsold at the end of the day. This app connects restaurants/catering services with soup kitchens in an effort to reduce or eliminate this food waste. It allows restaurants to create a profile and schedule a pick-up or drop-off at a nearby soup kitchen, and allows soup kitchens to contact registered restaurants when they need more donations.

I collaborated with Nili and Yuri to develop the app idea and general wireframe design and layout flow (see the InVision prototype [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/C5A0Q7JNQ#/screens/214277544)). It was fantastic to have input from a user perspective - it gave me great insight into project management and experience with how to balance feasibility against user priorities as a team.

## Deployment
This app is deployed on Heroku - [View App](https://feedable.herokuapp.com)

## Future Versions
- User login
- Schedule repeating pick-ups/drop-offs
- Connect with Lyft/Uber for pick-up
- Incorporate Google Maps API
